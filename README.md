## Technologies Used
For this project, I used several gems in order to display and navigate the information easily.  

* Devise was used for user authentication. I used this gem to enable the site to recognize whether the user logging in was a master admin user. The Master admin user can post new blogs as well as delete posts.
* API to Newsapi.org in order to pull the latest news from MTV.
* will_paginate gem enables the user to browse articles and go to the next page 
* faker gem enabled me to create a bunch of fake blog posts, which I hope to fill with real content!

## Next Steps
* I'd like to incorporate the Soundcloud API in order to embed songs within blog posts
* I'd like to incorporate animations and drop down menus to make logging in clearer for the user
* Button styling
